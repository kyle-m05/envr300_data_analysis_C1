Relevant variables for this project are:
-cooling degree days (CLDD), units of degrees Celsius
-heating degree days (HTDD), units of degrees Celsius
-average monthly temperature (TAVG), units of degrees Celsius
-maximum daily temperature in a month (TMAX), units of degrees Celsius
-minimum daily temperature in a month (TMIN), units of degrees Celsius

The number of cooling or  heating degree days on a given day is the excess of the average daily temperature above 65 degrees Fahrenheit or below 40 degrees Fahrenheit , respectively, and the monthly value is the sum of the daily values.  Degree-days and temperatures have been converted to units of degrees Celsius.
